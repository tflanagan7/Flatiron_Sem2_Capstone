### Project Overview
The Statcast Era in baseball has been a renasissance for baseball statisticians, and teams that can take advantage of the overwhelming bounty of data available in the sport give themselves a serious edge above their competition. The goal of this project is to build an ML model in Python capable of predicting MLB hitter performance in future seasons. To do this, we make use of the pybaseball package and import MLB player data from a combination of FanGraphs, Baseball Reference, and Baseball Savant. Through careful predictor selction and model tuning we were able to predict the WAR a player will get in a future season with a RMSE of 1.65, which is within 1 standard deviation for the stat.
