# Predicting MLB Player Performance

### Project Overview
The Statcast Era in baseball has been a renasissance for baseball statisticians, and teams that can take advantage of the overwhelming bounty of data available in the sport give themselves a serious edge above their competition. The goal of this project is to build an ML model in Python capable of predicting MLB hitter performance in future seasons. To do this, we make use of the pybaseball package and import MLB player data from a combination of FanGraphs, Baseball Reference, and Baseball Savant. Through careful predictor selction and model tuning we were able to predict the WAR a player will get in a future season with a RMSE of 1.65, which is within 1 standard deviation for the stat.

### Value of the Project

So what is the Statcast Era? Statcast was a **modern tracking technology** adopted by all 30 major league ballparks in 2015. It is an extremely high speed, and high accuracy automated tool that analyzes player movement, ball movement, and bat movement. From sprint speed to a 12-6 curveball's rpm Statcast is a very useful data source that is changing the game

Statcast's existence breathes new life into the role of **baseball statisticians who are now able to influence front office decision making, training and condition, and even the plays on the field**. 

To provide a few examples of ways the game has changed with the influence of statisticians:
* **The shift** is a much more common and exagerated phenominon, which will be banned in the 2023 season partially do the fact that it's too effective. The shift is where you'll **move players out of their normal positions to cover a part of the field the batter is statistically much more likely to hit the ball to**.
* It's no longer widely excepted that the best hitter in the lineup hits 3rd, some teams are placing their best hitters 2nd in the lineup now
* **The way managers manage their bullpen has changed**. The stats show that the 3rd time the opposing lineup faces your starting pitcher they start doing better, so in important games managers are pulling their starters earlier. When I was growing up watching the game you'd expect the starter who hasn't given up any runs will stay in and pitch all 9 innings if he keeps pitching well.

An additional business application exists for this project in the **sports betting industry**

According to an article published by Grand View Research in the 2022 Market Analysis Report 2022, the sports betting industry is "anticipated to grow at a comp annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% from 2022 to 2030, which would make it a **182 billion dollar industry**.

For companies posting sports betting lines, you need to make sure you're confident in the liklihood of a certain outcome or a certain player performance.

Finally, I think this project is **useful across other sports**. Your sport might be growing and your an organization that want's to offer players you sponsor a competitive edge. Or you might be coaching a soccer team and the league your in is very stubborn and traditional so theirs an opportunity to be the **first to adapt with the usage of predictive sports analysis**.
